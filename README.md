### *An Exploratory Data Analysis*
___

## Project Description 
Utilizing the _MTA Daily Ridership Data: 2020-2025_ dataset and the _MTA Subway Major Incidents: Beginning 2020 dataset from NY Open Data, four independent exploratory data analyses were conducted to generate relevant hypotheses and identify possible hidden patterns when measuring any changes in MTA Subway Ridership for 2020-2024 when taking major incidents into consideration.

___

## Execution
The _MTA Daily Ridership Data: 2020-2025_ dataset and the _MTA Subway Major Incidents: Beginning 20202_ dataset were either combined or filtered into 5 separate CSV files in order to more easily analyze the large amount of data. The data was pulled from both APIs with code detailed in three .py files = incidents.py, daily_ridership.py, and merge.py.

The _MTA Daily Ridership Data: 2020-2025_ dataset data was scraped from the API in 2 parts due to its size.
